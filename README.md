# Tip Calculator App

The Tip Calculator is a simple, user-friendly web application designed to help users easily calculate the tip amount and total cost per person for any bill. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on event listeners and DOM manipulation to create an interactive user experience.

## Features

- Bill Input: Users can input the total bill amount.
- Tip Selection: Users can select a tip percentage from predefined options or enter a custom percentage.
- Number of People: Users can specify the number of people sharing the bill to calculate the cost per person.
- Calculation Display: The app displays the calculated tip amount and total cost per person.
- Reset Functionality: Users can reset all inputs and calculations with a single click.

## How It Works

The application calculates the tip amount per person and the total amount per person based on the bill value, the tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the bill. Users can choose from predefined tip percentages or enter a custom value. The app validates input to ensure that values are not zero or negative, providing feedback to users for invalid inputs.

## Project Structure

- index.html: Contains the structure of the tip calculator app, including input fields for the bill amount, tip percentage, and number of people, as well as placeholders for displaying calculation results.
- styles.css: (Not included in the provided code) Styles the application to improve usability and aesthetics.
- script.js: Contains all the JavaScript needed to add functionality to the app. It handles user inputs, calculates the tip and total amounts per person, and updates the UI with the calculated results.

## Setup and Usage

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the index.html file in a web browser to use the application.
- Enter the total bill amount, select a tip percentage (or enter a custom one), and specify the number of people.
- The calculated tip amount and total cost per person will be displayed automatically.
- Use the "Reset" button to clear all inputs and start a new calculation.

## Learning Takeaways

- Event Listeners: Learned how to use event listeners to handle user interactions.
- DOM Manipulation: Gained experience in manipulating the DOM to update the user interface based on user input and calculations.
- Input Validation: Implemented input validation to ensure that users enter valid values, providing an error message for invalid inputs.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance mobile responsiveness.
- Add animations for user interactions.
- Implement more complex features like splitting the bill by different amounts per person.
